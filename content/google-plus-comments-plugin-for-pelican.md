There has been recently several discussions about 
[whether comments are any useful on blogs](http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-09/why-were-shutting-our-comments)
I think it is important to find better ways to connect blogs to social networks.
In my opinion the most suitable social network for this is Google+, because there is space for larger discussion, without Twitter's character limit.

So, for my small blog I've decided to implement the Google+ commenting system, which Google originally implemented just for Blogger but that [works on any website](http://browsingthenet.blogspot.com/2013/04/google-plus-comments-on-any-website.html).

See it in action below.

The plugin is available in the `googleplus_comments` branch in:
